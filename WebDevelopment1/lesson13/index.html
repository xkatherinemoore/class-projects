        <h2>About Us:</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to make music accessible to all, especially school age students. We accomplish this by providing resources to information both to access music education and increase its prevalence in your community. We provide information on why music is important to childhood development, how music is funded in public schools, and a simple form to contact your local school board and make a difference. We also provide information about local not-for-profit programs that focus on providing music education. All of this is in the hopes that we can add a little more music - and through that, a little more joy - to the world.</p>

        <h2>How to use this website:</h2>
        <p>The <a href="education.html">Why Music?</a> page provides information on the impacts of music on childhood development and research on the outcomes of music programs on both academic performance and social learning. This page also goes into how music programs are funded in public schools and provides a form to contact representatives on your local school board.</p>
        <p>The <a href="volunteer.html">Get Involved</a> page includes links to some of the largest not-for-profit organizations in the United States with a focus on music education. A description of the organization is included to help find the program that is suitable for your needs. These programs include providing direct education to children, resources to educators, and funding/grants for both physical necessities like instruments to live performances.</p>
