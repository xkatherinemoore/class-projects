        <h2>Our Mission Statement:</h2>
        <p>It is our goal to educate on the benefits of music on child development and provide resources to further those goals. Studies have shown that access to music education results in better academic performance, better test scores, and fewer behavioral problems. We aim to give all students the opportunity to study music and make it easier to enact change. </p>

        <h2>Our Commitment to Accessibility:</h2>
        <p>Accessibility means available to all. We strive to make our work accessible to all individuals and to make that access equal in both content and impact, regardless of technology used. We view the internet as a place for inclusion, allowing for equal access and contribution regardless of race, gender, religion, national origin, age, disability, or sexual orientation. By creating an environment that fosters inclusiveness, we strive to generate the best perspectives and insights to create a path to further innovation.</p>
