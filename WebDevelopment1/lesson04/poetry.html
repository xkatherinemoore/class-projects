        <h2>Jabberwocky</h2>
        <p>by Lewis Carroll</p>
        <p>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
            Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
            All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
            And the mome raths outgrabe. </p>
      
        <p><em>“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br>
            The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>
        Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br>
            The frumious Bandersnatch!” </em></p>
      
        <p>He took his vorpal sword in hand;<br>
            Long time the manxome foe he sought—<br>
        So rested he by the Tumtum tree<br>
            And stood awhile in thought. </p>
      
        <p>And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br>
            The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br>
        Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br>
            And burbled as it came! </p>
      
        <p><em>One, two! One, two!</em> And through and through<br>
            The vorpal blade went <em>snicker-snack!</em><br>
        He left it dead, and with its head<br>
            He went galumphing back. </p>
      
        <p><em>“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?<br>
            Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br>
        O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”</em><br>
            He chortled in his joy. </p>
      
        <p>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
            Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
        All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
            And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>
