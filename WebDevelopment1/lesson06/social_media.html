        <p>Social media is a means for people to interact with others over the Internet. Different social media websites have different approaches or a focus to that interaction. One of the main appeals to social media is that anyone can make an account or profile, and most social media websites do not require extensive or specialized computer knowledge to use.</p>
            
        <h2>Examples of Social Media</h2>
        <!--A description list was used because each element (social media site) had multiple components (description of the site and logo)-->
        <dl>
            <dt style="font-size: large; font-weight: bolder;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a></dt>
            <dd>Facebook was originally meant to be a way to interact with people you know in real life and share life events or updates. In recent years, it has expanded to also allow for business pages, the Marketplace to list items for sale locally, groups to meet people with common interests, and even dating.</dd>
            <dd style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="images/facebook.png" alt="The Facebook logo" width="50px"></a><br>

            <dt style="font-size: large; font-weight: bolder;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a></dt>
            <dd>Instagram provides a means to share pictures (and more recently videos) online. Like Facebook, Instagram was originally used mainly to interact with people you knew in real life, but public pages for businesses as well as individuals have become incredibly common. </dd>
            <dd style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="images/instagram.png" alt="The Instagram logo" width="50px"></a><br>
            <small>Source: <a href="https://about.meta.com/brand/resources/instagram/instagram-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram Brand Resources</a></small></dd>
            
            <dt style="font-size: large; font-weight: bolder;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn&reg;</a></dt>
            <dd>LinkedIn is a platform used for professional networking and achievements. Individual profiles are essentially a public resume that can be viewed by other professionals. LinkedIn also offers professional development through LinkedIn Learning as well as job postings and company pages.</dd>
            <dd style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="images/linkedin.png" alt="The LinkedIn logo" width="50px"></a><br>
